# Carpooling Android application TIPE project

This project was my prep class project for TIPE.
The first and main goal was to determine whether or not the use of a carpooling application
in a whole high school, with roughly 1,000 students and 200 residential students,
could reduce significantly its greenhouse gas emission. At the end, the question was to know how much the same mobile application scaled to the Guadeloupe island (400,000 people) could prevent greenhouse gas emission.
